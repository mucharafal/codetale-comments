We definitely don't want this data in every log line.\r\n\r\nWe have two competing concerns:\r\n\r\n1. @oliverse-da, among others, have asked for shorter log lines that don't contain unnecessary information. They have moved to multi-line logging which is incompatible with the Daml SDK without a lot of rewriting.\r\n2. You, among others, require this information.\r\n3. Our one-off logging information is unstructured, and hard to manipulate.\r\n\r\nSo here's what I suggest:\r\n\r\n1. We move the request data to the structured logging context, but _only_ for the `info` line, after which it is discarded.\r\n2. We look into correlation IDs for requests which allow us to correlate log lines.\r\n3. In the future, we find a way to automatically log the entire request in a structured format (i.e. JSON), without explicit logging code.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
